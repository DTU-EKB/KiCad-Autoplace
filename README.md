# KiCad-Autoplace

Connectivity-aware **automatic PCB component placement** for KiCad 9, maintained
for students at DTU Ballerup Campus. A companion to
[KiCad-components](https://github.com/DTU-EKB/KiCad-components): that repo gives
you the symbols and footprints, this one places them.

Lock the parts you care about (connectors, mounting holes), press the button, and
the engine places the rest — minimising wirelength and keeping the board
single-sided-routable so the existing routing workflow can finish it.

> Status: **0.1.0 / development.** The placement engine (force-directed global +
> legalize) runs end-to-end on real boards with zero overlaps. Beating a careful
> hand-placement on structured boards needs the block-floorplan + simulated-
> annealing work tracked in [`docs/BUILD_SPEC.md`](docs/BUILD_SPEC.md) (M3–M4).

## Install (KiCad Plugin & Content Manager)
Go to *Plugin and Content Manager* on the KiCad project screen → *Manage…* beside
the Repository dropdown → **+** → paste:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DTU-EKB/KiCad-Autoplace/main/repository.json
```
Refresh the manager, install **DTU EKB Autoplace**, restart KiCad. A toolbar
button appears in the PCB editor.

## Use
1. Open your board in the PCB editor.
2. **Lock** the footprints that must stay put (edge connectors, mounting holes).
3. Click **Autoplace (DTU-EKB)** in the toolbar.
4. Review the before/after report (HPWL, crossings, overlaps). Reload if needed.

The engine never moves locked footprints and guarantees an overlap-free result.

## Develop / run headless
The engine core is pure Python (no `pcbnew`); only `kicad_io` touches KiCad. Run
the dev CLI with KiCad's bundled Python:
```powershell
& "C:\Program Files\KiCad\9.0\bin\python.exe" cli.py metrics  board.kicad_pcb
& "C:\Program Files\KiCad\9.0\bin\python.exe" cli.py place    board.kicad_pcb out.kicad_pcb
```
`place` writes `<stem>.autoplaced.kicad_pcb` by default — it never overwrites the
input unless you pass an output path equal to it.

Unit tests for the headless core run under any Python:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```
